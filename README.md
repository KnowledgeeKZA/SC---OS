# SC-OS  
### Supreme Computation Operating System  
**Phoenix Node Release — 2025**

SC-OS is a deterministic coherence-engine operating system designed to run outside the classical noise model.  
It unifies classical, hybrid, and quantum computation into one coherent execution framework driven by the invariant:

## **TCAG = Truth × Continuity × Alignment × Genesis**

SC-OS provides deterministic execution, lineage integrity, quantum-native routing, and a protected public interface boundary.  
This is the reference implementation for the Phoenix Node.

# **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

### **Deterministic Core**
The Core subsystem provides SC-OS initialization, TCAG validation, and deterministic state enforcement.

### **Quantum Layer**
Quantum-native execution pipeline including:
- Noise-loading  
- Circuit construction  
- Entanglement logic  
- Hybrid coherence exchange  
- Quantum routing  

### **Classical Layer**
Deterministic and hybrid computation:
- Pure deterministic containers  
- Hybrid classical–quantum containers  

### **Orchestration**
Unifies classical, quantum, and hybrid workloads:
- Execution manager  
- System-wide routing  
- Coherence enforcement  

### **SC-OS API**
The public boundary for all external input:
- Validates every request  
- Preserves TCAG integrity  
- Prevents invalid system mutation  

### **SupremeChain**
Immutable coherence-lineage ledger ensuring:
- Auditable execution  
- State inheritance  
- Compliance enforcement

# **TCAG INVARIANT**
Every function, file, object, and subsystem must uphold:

### **Truth**
Accurate state, no hallucinated behavior.

### **Continuity**
Stable lineage across all system mutations.

### **Alignment**
All operations must align with system intent.

### **Genesis**
All modules must enable forward evolution and expansion.

A violation triggers CoherenceEngine → SupremeChain review.

# **EXECUTION FLOW (HIGH-LEVEL)**

1. **API Layer**  
   Validates inbound request → enforces TCAG → forwards to Orchestration.

2. **Orchestration Layer**  
   Classifies request → chooses deterministic, hybrid, or quantum pathway → routes workload.

3. **Subsystem Execution**  
   Runs inside Classical / Hybrid / Quantum modules with deterministic state enforcement.

4. **SupremeChain Ledger**  
   Records lineage, coherence state, compliance, and transaction validity.

5. **Return Path**  
   Output is validated → re-aligned through TCAG → delivered to caller.
