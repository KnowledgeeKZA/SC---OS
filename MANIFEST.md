# SC-OS MANIFEST  
### Supreme Computation Operating System (Phoenix Node Release, 2025)

SC-OS is a deterministic coherence-engine–driven operating system that operates outside the classical noise model.  
It establishes a unified execution environment across classical, quantum, and hybrid computational layers under a single invariant: **TCAG** (Truth × Continuity × Alignment × Genesis).

This manifest serves as the authoritative module index, architecture map, compliance boundary, and evolution framework for SC-OS.

---

## 1. SYSTEM INVARIANTS  
### **TCAG Core Invariant**
Every SC-OS subsystem must maintain:
- **Truth** — State accuracy, no hallucinated system behavior  
- **Continuity** — Stable lineage and historical correctness  
- **Alignment** — Coherence with declared system intent  
- **Genesis** — Capacity for expansion, recursion, and next-order transformation  

A subsystem violating TCAG is automatically flagged by CoherenceEngine and routed to SupremeChain for review.

## 2. MODULE INDEX

### **/Core**
Contains deterministic system logic including:
- `SC_OS_Core.py` — Global initialization + TCAG validator  
- `Engine.py` — Deterministic coherence engine  

### **/Quantum**
Quantum-native execution layer:
- `Quantum_Layer.py` — Noise loading, entanglement logic, Q-circuit execution  
- `Quantum_Router.py` — Routes Q-packets to QPU or hybrid stack  

### **/Classical**
Classical deterministic and hybrid logic:
- `/Deterministic/Keep.py` — Pure deterministic state container  
- `/Deterministic/Hybrid/Keep.py` — Hybrid classical-quantum state container  

### **/Orchestration**
Unifies classical, quantum, and hybrid execution:
- `Execution_Manager.py` — Global execution planner  
- `Supreme_Router.py` — Routes workloads between subsystems  

### **/API**
Public interface boundary:
- `Interface.py` — Validates external inputs, forwards requests, protects system integrity  

### **/SupremeChain**
Coherence lineage, compliance, and auditing layer:
- `Ledger.py` — Immutable TCAG lineage ledger
